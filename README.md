# Equivalent Salary Converter Using PPP

A salary of INR 45k is roughly equal to $600 but if you move from India to USA, $600 cannot give you the same standard of living. You cannot purchase the same goods and services for $600 that you used to get for INR 45k in India.

PPP or purchasing power parity comees into the play to get a fair conversion rate. This project converts the amount using PPP concept and gives you a quick `Conversion Factor` between two selected countries. As of today, the conversion factor between India and USA is 3.4 which means for the same job, the salary in the US should be around 3.4x
